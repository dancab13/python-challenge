# python-challenge
Materials for the Python challenge of Module 3 in the Columbia BCS Data Analytics boot camp.

There are comments explaining my process and the code (including how to use the code) in each main.py file.

Some concepts and functions came from research on the web, particularly from Stack Overflow. I tried to mention specific references when possible. BCS's Xpert Assistant helped me figure out how to compare a current row of a list with a previous row (though this was extremely similar to how we did it in VBA, just slightly modified). I modified Xpert Assistant's code to make it my own and specific to the challenge. All other code is my own unless specified otherwise.

My analysis is as follows:
-I would not do business with PyBank as its profits and losses fluctuates wildly from month to month. The average P/L change is negative.
-Diana DeGette won the election by a landslide with more than 73% of the vote with almost 370,000 people voting.
